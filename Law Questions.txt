Questions:
-------------
- After filing, how long does it take to serve notice to the spouse?
   ** 2-3 days. but you can choose to serve after couple of months also. but of course don't file until you are ready to serve.
- what are different ways to serve the papers?
   ** by mail or processor 
- if she visits Texas, how can we ensure that she is served during a narrow 2-3 hour window on a specific day?
  ** yes
- will i end up paying her attorney fees?
  ** No, because she has access to community property (her salary) and she does not have much family expenses (mortgage, grocery etc)

Jurisdiction:
---------------
- is it true that if she is served when she visits Texas, then TX court has personal jurisdiction to decide the divorce including property division and alimony ?
** not necessarily. she has to have ties/minimum contact. 
  ** No - if you moved here with intention of divorce or she has only visited TX with no intension of moving here.
  ** YES - if she buys property here or signs lease, or frequently visits with intention of moving then .
- If she has visited TX once or twice (which i can prove using air ticket bookings), is it enough for TX court to have personal jurisdiction (including property division and alimony)?
- If i file first in TX and serve papers to her and she then immediately files in MA:
  - do both cases run in parallel or MA court will yield to TX and dismiss it's case?
    ** only one court will decide all aspects of the case, other court dismisses the case. both judges review the case for jurisdiction and may have a phone call to decide.
  - if wife is not willing to move to TX, what else can help establish her minimum contact to TX?
  ** having a property in TX.
- even if TX court takes jurisdiction, can wife request MA court to decide just the property/alimony part  while the TX case is pending? 
  ** No, MA court will dismiss the case.
- once the divorce is finalized, if she files in MA for alimony as per MA laws, will MA court take that case?
  ** TX property and alimony decision is non-modifiable, unless payor's income goes down. 

Job Change/moving to India
----------------------------
I am leaving my current job of 225k salary and moving India at $50 salary, because I/we always intended to move back to india when our son goes to college, to care for aging parents, to be with relatives/old friends and also because i suffer from depression (therapist has advised to move to India). In india salary for my skill-set is 50-60. even if i stay in US, i'll need to find a job that will allow me to work from india for several months a year. also I lack the necessary skills for my current job. so it is very stressful and affecting my health. average salary for my skill-set in TX is around $100k.
 - will court calculate alimony based on my past income or current income?
 ** alimony is based on current and recent income, not future income.
 - How to prove to court that i always intended to move to India
 - will court consider depression as a factor in support of India move?
 - Does it make a difference if i quit the US job before filing or if i do it after filing ? 

Alimony:
-----------
  - how much alimony the court is likely to order given the numbers?
  - "her financial needs" : what things are considered when calculating her needs? 
	- does family's per month savings included in the needs?
  - what are the chances that her 50k per year income is considered not enough for her needs?  

Other questions:
-----------------  
- are emails, texts and phone records considered marital property?
- If i suspect that my wife likely has or had bank accounts that she has not listed in the papers, 
  can we subpoena her personal emails, text and phone records to see what financial instituions she has ties with? 
   do we need to provide any evidence for the suspicion?
- if wife is a beneficiary on a relative's bank account does she must disclose or can she just say she is not aware of any?
- wife may have withdrawn large cash from her bank accounts months or over a year ago:
  - can she simply claim it was for family expenditures?
  - if she can not provide evidence as to what she spent it on, will court assume that she still has it?
  - is paying cash to charity (like to homeless people), church considered family expense?
  - taking coworkers/recruiters to dinners/events regulary as part of networking considered family expense?

Loans:
--------
 - i had taken loan from family members (bank transfer, paying bills directly out of their account)
   - does there need to be a written loan agreement for that to be a marital debt?
   - do the loan agreements must be notarized in the US or can it be signed and notarized in India?
   - my dad wants me to pay-off loans ASAP, so i will need to transfer the house to him or get a second mortgage to pay him or he wants a lien on the house.any reason court will order the lien to be not valid and hence removed?   
 
Future income, gifts, inheritance:
-----------------------------------
- can court order a spouse to pay other spouse from future inheritance?
- can court require a spouse to report future income for alimony purpose?

Your Fees structure
-------------------
- retainer, hourly rate(s) (legal, paralegal), email/phone call rates, discovery, physical appearence 
- are there any passive/background activities that incur fees?
- do you ask client before hiring any in-house/third-party experts?
