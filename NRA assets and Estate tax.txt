US house owned by a foreigner, selling price is bet 300k and 1 million:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  When it is sold :
	- Buyer must withhold 15% of the selling price . 
		withholding rate is 10% if buyer plans to live in the house.
	- actual capital gains tax is 15% of the PROFIT (not selling price) 
	- foreigner needs to claim refund of the difference : taxes withheld minus applicable capital gains tax

  When foreigner dies:
	- first $60k is tax free
	- then estate tax starts at 20% for $10k and 37% for value over $500k

  Gifting real estate by foreigner to a US citizen:
	- First $18k is free
	- then rate is same as for Estate Tax

Living Revocable Trust	
-----------------------
  - all assets (bank account, real estate, family loan) can be part of trust. this avoids probate.
  - Beneficiary can also be the Trustee who manages the trust, this makes the process simple
  - upon grantor's death, trustee can pay off the family loan then distribute remaining assets to the beneficiary
  - Any assets remaining after loan pay-off are subject to estate tax, if total is more than $60k.

	
Foreigner's POD bank account:
-----------------------------
	- Lawyer on Justia said all US assets are subject to Estate tax, no exceptions
	- but ChatGPT says : bank accounts are not subject to Estate tax because they are not considered US-situs
	- Banks requires beneficiary to provide copy of IRS transfer Certificate to ensure all estate tax obligations are all set. Getting the cert 6 to 9 months

Estate tax for a non-resident alien's US bank account

Hello - A non-resident alien (from Nepal) has $200k in US bank savings account and $300k in US Govt bonds. A US citizen daughter is named as a beneficiary (payable on death) on both assets. If the owner dies, is estate tax applicable to any of these assets provided there are no other claims?

Would the bank/institution simply transfer the funds/bonds to the beneficiary after verifying the documents (beneficiary ID, address, owner's ID, death certificate, proof of relationship) or do they generally also require the beneficiary to provide a copy of IRS transfer certificate?

Would the assets be considered income for the beneficiary requiring them to pay income tax on them?

Thanks,
